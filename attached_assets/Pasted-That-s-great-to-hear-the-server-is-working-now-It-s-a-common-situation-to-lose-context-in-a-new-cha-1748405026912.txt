That's great to hear the server is working now! It's a common situation to lose context in a new chat window.

To get the Replit AI back up to speed quickly, here's a suggestion for a comprehensive prompt you can give it:

Suggested Prompt for Replit AI:

"Hello! We are continuing work on the ReAlign project, version 2.1.

Current Status:

We have just successfully completed all tasks for Phase 0: Foundation & Core AI Scaffolding. This includes:
Database schema implementation based on "ReAlign 2.1 - Enhanced Data Model 1.0.docx" (15 tables, migration file migrations/0000_large_cardiac.sql created).
Backend services for User Authentication (with RBAC), User Context Profiles, Structured Workflow Logging, and Normalized BFS/UBA Data APIs.
The Context Recipe Framework has been defined.
OpenAPI specifications have been created.
AI service integration (OpenAI) is configured.
The server is now starting correctly after we resolved issues with transactionController.ts and authController.ts.
We confirmed that the UBA Guide rules are to be used as annotated in the core 2.1 documents.
Next Step:
We are ready to begin Phase 1: Maker Module - Core Tools with Premium AI Integration.
Specifically, we need to start with Task 1.1: Maker Module - BFS/UBA Form Maker as detailed in the "ReAlign 2.1 - Phased Implementation Plan_.docx". This involves implementing the conversational intake experience and the frontend UI for the BFS/UBA Form Maker, adhering strictly to UBA Guide rules.

Key Project Documents you should be aware of (I have uploaded these previously):

ReAlign 2.1 - Phased Implementation Plan_.docx (This is our primary guide for phases and tasks)
ReAlign 2.1 - Master Guide for AI Agent.docx (Overall guidance for you as the AI agent)
ReAlign PRD 2.1.2.docx (Product requirements)
ReAlign 2.1 - Enhanced Data Model 1.0.docx (Database schema)
ReAlign 2.1 - UBA.pdf (The UBA form structure)
Annotations and details from the "how to fill out borrower assistance form.docx" (UBA Guide) are embedded within the PRD, Phased Plan, and Data Model.
ReAlign 2.0 - Unified Design & Structure Guide.docx (UI/UX)
ReAlign 2.0 UI & Navigation - Implementation Guide.docx (UI/UX)
The full GitHub repository realignmvp code that was previously uploaded.
Please confirm you have this context, and let's proceed with developing the BFS/UBA Form Maker (Task 1.1)."
