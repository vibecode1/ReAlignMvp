This document outlines the requirements for borrowers seeking assistance with distressed properties through various remedies or disposal options, including the data and supporting evidence they need to provide, and the general rules for approval or denial based on the Fannie Mae Servicing Guide dated April 9, 2025.
General Notes on Borrower Documentation:
* Borrower Response Package (BRP): For many workout options, a BRP is a key requirement. A complete BRP typically includes:
   * A fully completed Mortgage Assistance Application (Form 710) or an equivalent form requesting the same financial information, hardship details, and attestations.
   * Income documentation, generally not more than 90 days old (180 days if impacted by a disaster). This varies by income type:
      * Wages and Salaries: Paystubs, W-2s, tax returns, etc. (as outlined in Form 710).
      * Self-Employed: Profit & loss statements, tax returns, bank statements (as outlined in Form 710).
      * Other Income (Social Security, disability, rental, etc.): Benefit statements, lease agreements, bank statements (as outlined in Form 710).
      * Non-Borrower Household Member Income: May be considered if voluntarily provided, properly documented and verified, the contributor occupies the property as a principal residence, and there's evidence of routine contribution to household expenses/mortgage payment.
      * Non-Taxable Income: An "adjusted gross income" is developed by adding an amount equivalent to 25% of the non-taxable income (or a higher actual tax rate if determinable) to the borrower's income.
      * Income Documented by Bank Statements: An "adjusted gross income" is developed by adding an amount equivalent to 25% of the amount documented (or a higher actual tax rate if determinable).
   * Hardship documentation, as outlined in Form 710, based on the type of hardship.
   * IRS IVES Request for Transcript of Tax Return (IRS Form 4506-C), signed by the borrower, may be required to reconcile inconsistencies, if Fannie Mae requests it, or if a self-employed borrower doesn't provide standard income documentation.
* A BRP is considered incomplete if Form 710 is only partially filled, lacks required income or hardship documentation, or is missing a required IRS Form 4506-C.
* For borrowers in active Chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy, a copy of the bankruptcy schedule(s) (if not more than 90 days old) may be accepted in lieu of Form 710, along with tax returns if required.
Home Retention Options
1. Forbearance Plan
* What Servicers Need from Borrowers/Data/Evidence:
   * Servicers are authorized to evaluate for a forbearance plan without receiving a complete BRP.
   * The borrower must have an eligible hardship. (Form 710 lists types of eligible hardships, although a BRP is not mandatory for evaluation).
   * The property securing the mortgage loan must generally be a principal residence. This rule is waived if the hardship is due to a disaster event, in which case a second home or investment property may be eligible.
   * The property must not be condemned or abandoned, though it may be vacant.
   * Quality Right Party Contact (QRPC) with the borrower must generally be achieved. An exception exists for disaster events where the property is in a FEMA-Declared Disaster Area eligible for Individual Assistance, the loan was current or less than two months delinquent at the time of the disaster, and is now at least one month delinquent; in such cases, an initial forbearance of up to 3 months can be offered without QRPC.
* Rules for Approval/Denial (Eligibility Criteria & Key Terms):
   * Borrower has an eligible hardship.
   * Property type and occupancy meet guidelines (principal residence, with disaster exceptions).
   * Property is not condemned or abandoned.
   * QRPC is achieved (with disaster exceptions).
   * An initial forbearance plan term of up to 6 months may be offered, with a possible extension of up to 6 additional months.
   * Payments are reduced or suspended during the plan.
   * The plan may be terminated if the borrower fails to meet its terms, the hardship is resolved, or the borrower requests termination.

   * The borrower must have experienced a temporary hardship that now appears to be resolved.
   * The borrower must demonstrate the financial capacity to make the regular contractual payments plus the additional amount to cure the delinquency over the plan term. This may be verified through QRPC if a BRP is not submitted.

   * The delinquency must have resulted from a temporary hardship that appears to be resolved.
   * For plans up to 6 months and loan delinquency ≤ 90 days:

Home Liquidation Options
6. Fannie Mae Short Sale
* What Servicers Need from Borrowers/Data/Evidence:
   * BRP Requirements:

   * If current or less than 90 days delinquent: Complete BRP required. (If current or <60 days delinquent, imminent default must be determined per D2-1-01, which requires BRP, non-retirement cash reserves < $25,000, documented hardship, and specific credit or hardship criteria ).
   * If 90 days to 18 months delinquent: Complete BRP generally required, unless specific exceptions are met (e.g., failed Flex Mod TPP, prior Flex Mod with early default, ≥3 prior mods, certain forbearances, or non-investment property with FICO ≤620).
   * If greater than 18 months delinquent: No BRP required.
   * If Chapter 7 bankruptcy debt discharged (including the mortgage): No BRP required; proof of discharge is needed.
   * Evidence of intent to pursue a short sale.
   * Property must be listed with a licensed real estate agent on the MLS for a minimum of five consecutive calendar days (including a weekend) prior to the servicer submitting a recommendation to Fannie Mae.
   * Borrower must allow timely and sufficient access to the property for valuation purposes.
   * Borrower remains responsible for property maintenance until the sale closes.
   * Sales contract must include a contingency clause ("contingent on the mortgage holder’s and the mortgage insurer’s, if applicable, agreement to the sale") and a specific cancellation clause.
   * All parties involved in the short sale transaction must sign and date a Short Sale Affidavit (Form 191) at closing.
   * Borrower must provide details of property improvements if requesting MI termination based on current value due to improvements.
   * Rules for Approval/Denial (Eligibility Criteria & Key Terms):
   * Eligibility is evaluated based on the delinquency status of the loan and BRP requirements as outlined above.
   * If the borrower obtained a new mortgage loan within six months prior to the delinquency on the subject property (or within six months prior to the short sale evaluation for a current loan), the short sale is only eligible if the hardship was due to distant employment transfer/relocation (>50 miles, principal residence), new employment (>50 miles, principal residence), or PCS orders (>50 miles, principal residence). Other situations require Fannie Mae review.
   * Cash Contribution: May be required from the borrower if non-retirement cash reserves exceed $10,000 OR their housing expense-to-income ratio is 40% or less (calculated per F-1-14 ). This is not required if prohibited by law, if the servicer evaluated the borrower without a BRP under the specified exceptions, or for certain servicemembers with PCS orders. The initial request is the greater of 20% of non-retirement cash reserves or four times the contractual monthly PITI, not to exceed the deficiency. This amount is negotiable by the servicer based on the borrower's circumstances. If the loan is current or less than 60 days delinquent, a minimum contribution of 20% of non-retirement cash reserves is mandatory. The contribution requirement is waived if the calculated amount is less than $500.
   * Relocation Assistance: Borrowers may receive $7,500 from Fannie Mae for relocation expenses if the property was their principal residence, unless a cash contribution is required (even if not made), or if they are a servicemember with PCS orders receiving a DLA or other government relocation aid.
   * The borrower or purchaser must not receive any funds or commissions from the sale, except for the relocation incentive.
   * A deficiency waiver is provided for certain mortgage loans (non-MI loans or MI loans with delegated authority).
   * Deed restrictions apply to the purchaser regarding resale price and timing.
7. Fannie Mae Mortgage Release (Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure)
   * What Servicers Need from Borrowers/Data/Evidence:
   * The borrower must not be involved in or party to litigation (other than foreclosure or bankruptcy) involving the subject property or mortgage loan.
   * BRP Requirements: (Similar to Short Sale)

      * If current or less than 90 days delinquent: Complete BRP required. (If current or <60 days delinquent, imminent default must be determined per D2-1-01, which requires BRP, non-retirement cash reserves < $25,000, documented hardship, and specific credit or hardship criteria ).
      * If 90 days to 18 months delinquent: Complete BRP generally required, unless specific exceptions are met (similar to short sale exceptions).
      * If greater than 18 months delinquent: No BRP required.
      * If Chapter 7 bankruptcy debt discharged (including the mortgage): No BRP required; proof of discharge is needed.
      * The borrower must execute the deed of conveyance and a personal property release (Form 192 is optional for personal property release).

         * Occupant (borrower or tenant) must have verifiable income (not required for the 3-month no-rent option).
         * Occupant must agree to maintain the property, keep it in good condition, and permit marketing for sale.
         * Number of occupants must be appropriate and comply with local laws/HOA rules.
         * If pets are present, renter's insurance may be required.
         * Occupants signing the lease must agree to a credit review, and all residents over 18 must have an acceptable background check, including OFAC clearance.
         * Borrowers must execute a general release of all claims in favor of Fannie Mae, the servicer, and their agents.
         * Rules for Approval/Denial (Eligibility Criteria & Key Terms):
         * Eligibility is evaluated based on the delinquency status of the loan and BRP requirements as outlined above.
         * If the borrower obtained a new mortgage loan within six months prior to the delinquency (or evaluation for current loans), the Mortgage Release is only eligible under the same hardship conditions as a Short Sale (distant employment transfer, new employment, or PCS orders, all >50 miles for a principal residence).
         * The property must be free of environmental contamination and not pose potential legal risks, and be in acceptable condition.
         * Cash Contribution: May be required from the borrower under the same rules and calculations as for a Short Sale.
         * Relocation Assistance: Borrowers may receive $7,500 from Fannie Mae for relocation expenses if the property was their principal residence, under the same rules and exceptions as for a Short Sale.
         * A deficiency waiver is provided for certain mortgage loans (non-MI loans or MI loans with delegated authority).
         * Mortgage Release Transition Options Eligibility: The loan must be a first lien on a single-family property, not government-insured/guaranteed.

Other Property-Related Requests
8. Evaluating a Request for the Release, or Partial Release, of Property Securing a Mortgage Loan (General)
         * What Servicers Need from Borrowers/Data/Evidence (General):
         * For any request under this section (easements, mineral rights, partial release, addition of land, partition, substitution of property, condemnation, lease for semi-permanent structure, subdivision), the borrower must submit a completed Application for Release of Security (Form 236) and all other documentation required per that form.
         * Specific documentation for each type of request (e.g., surveys, appraisals, legal descriptions, government notices for condemnation) will be detailed on Form 236 or required by the servicer to make an evaluation.
         * Specific Rules for Approval/Denial by Request Type:
         * Release of Beneficial Easement: Approved if no adverse effect on property value or use. If value is adversely affected, approval conditioned on LTV remaining below 60% or borrower paying down mortgage to maintain prior LTV or 60% LTV (whichever is higher). Denied if future use/marketability is expected to be adversely affected.
         * Grant of Burdensome Easement: Customary public utility easements generally approved if they meet specific location/non-interference criteria. Other easements approved if no adverse value impact, or if LTV with easement is <60%, or borrower pays down mortgage. Denied if long-term negative implications for value/foreclosability or if granted on a limited basis. Lien subordination possible under certain conditions.
         * Lease of Oil, Gas, or Mineral Rights: Requires loan to be current, originated >12 months prior, and good payment history. Lease must be customary, not prevent residential use or create hazards, value reduction not to exceed royalties, and drill site >500ft from structures. Approval if LTV with lease <60% (royalties can be waived by FNMA); if LTV ≥60%, royalties must be applied to loan balance to maintain prior LTV or 60% LTV.
         * Partial Release of Real Property: Requires loan to be current, originated >12 months prior, and good payment history. FNMA lien priority must not be impacted, and property must remain accessible. Approval if LTV after release <60%; if LTV ≥60%, borrower must pay down loan to maintain prior LTV or 60% LTV.
         * Addition of Land: Requires loan to be current, originated >12 months prior, and good payment history. FNMA lien priority not impacted. Added parcel conveyed entirely, similar zoning, results in one dwelling unit on total property (limited non-res structures ok). No hazards on added land, adjoined to existing property. Approval if LTV after addition <60%; if LTV ≥60%, borrower pays down to maintain prior LTV or 60% LTV.
         * Partition of Real Property: Requires loan to be current, originated >12 months prior, and good payment history. FNMA lien priority not impacted. Partition meets legal/zoning requirements, primary dwelling on a single retained parcel. Approval if LTV after partition <60%; if LTV ≥60%, borrower pays down to maintain prior LTV or 60% LTV. If co-borrower released, remaining borrower must qualify.
         * Substitution of Property Securing a Mortgage Loan: All requests submitted to Fannie Mae. If approved, borrower is responsible for costs/risks of moving/rebuilding dwelling and new flood insurance if needed.
         * Partial or Total Taking by Condemnation/Eminent Domain: Borrower submits Form 236. Servicer evaluates if compensation award is accurate. Approval if award satisfies debt or if award doesn't satisfy debt but valuation requirements met and LTV ≤ prior LTV. Proceeds generally applied to debt.
         * Lease Real Property for Installation of Semi-Permanent Structure (e.g., wind turbine): Requires loan current, originated >12 months prior, good payment history. Lease doesn't prevent residential use or cause hazards, structure >500ft from dwelling. Approval if LTV with structure <60% (lease payments can be waived by FNMA); if LTV ≥60%, lease payments must reduce loan balance to maintain prior LTV or 60% LTV.
         * Subdivision of Real Property: Requires loan current, originated >12 months prior, good payment history. FNMA lien priority not impacted. Existing structures on one new lot. Subdivision meets legal/zoning codes. Approval if LTV after subdivision <60%; if LTV ≥60%, borrower pays down to maintain prior LTV or 60% LTV.
Note on "Partial Claims" and "Compromise Sale": The term "partial claim" is not explicitly used as a standalone workout option in this Servicing Guide's table of contents. However, the guide does cover Government Mortgage Loan Modifications (D2-3.2-03, F-1-15 ), and procedures for filing claims with government insurers like FHA (E-4.5-02 ), which may involve similar concepts depending on the specific government program rules.
The term "compromise sale" is not used in this Servicing Guide. The most comparable option detailed is a "Fannie Mae Short Sale" (D2-3.3-01, F-1-14 ), where the property is sold for less than the total amount owed
