This is a major breakthrough! The logs clearly show the issue:
- Client-Side `AuthContext.tsx` calls `apiRequest` for `/api/v1/auth/me`.
- `apiRequest` in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` logs: `apiRequest: Token retrieved from localStorage = "undefined..."`
- Consequently, it sends an `Authorization: Bearer undefined` header.
- The server's `auth.middleware` receives this "undefined" token (length 9) and correctly rejects it as an invalid JWT, leading to the 401 on `/api/v1/auth/me`.

The root cause is that `localStorage.getItem('realign_token')` is returning "undefined" (or the string "undefined") at the time `AuthContext.tsx` (via `apiRequest`) tries to fetch it after the redirect.

We need to check what value is being stored for 'realign_token' in the first place.

Please:

1.  **Inspect the `RegisterNegotiator.tsx` client-side console logs from the PREVIOUS successful registration step:**
    * Find the log line: `console.log('Registration API response:', response);`
    * Examine the `response` object in that log. What is the actual value of `response.token` that is then passed to `localStorage.setItem('realign_token', response.token);`? Is `response.token` itself `undefined`, an empty string, or the literal string "undefined"?

2.  **If `response.token` from the API is valid (a long JWT string):**
    * Add a log in `RegisterNegotiator.tsx` immediately *after* `localStorage.setItem('realign_token', response.token);` to read it back and log it:
        ```typescript
        localStorage.setItem('realign_token', response.token);
        console.log('RegisterNegotiator: Token stored in localStorage =', localStorage.getItem('realign_token')); // ADD THIS LOG
        ```
    * This will confirm if it's being set correctly immediately before the redirect.

3.  **If `response.token` from the API is indeed `undefined` or invalid:**
    * We need to re-examine `server/controllers/authController.ts` in the `registerNegotiator` function. Ensure that `authData.session?.access_token` is a valid string and is being correctly returned as `token` in the JSON response. Add a server-side log there to show the token being sent back.

Let's first confirm the value of `response.token` being received and stored by `RegisterNegotiator.tsx`. This will tell us if the problem is with the token generation/return from the server, or with how it's being stored/retrieved in `localStorage` across the redirect.
