You're right, the server crashed again, and thanks for providing the content of server/controllers/ubaFormController.ts.

I've examined the file, and the error message is spot on:
Error [TransformError]: Transform failed with 2 errors: /home/runner/workspace/server/controllers/ubaFormController.ts:305:13: ERROR: Multiple exports with the same name "ubaFormController" /home/runner/workspace/server/controllers/ubaFormController.ts:305:13: ERROR: The symbol "ubaFormController" has already been declared

Looking at the file you provided, the issue is that export const ubaFormController = { ... }; is declared twice in the same file.

The first declaration starts near the beginning and includes methods like createUbaForm, getUbaForm, updateUbaForm, addDocumentAttachment, and getFormValidationStatus.
Then, after this first object is closed, there's another block of code that re-imports several modules and then declares export const ubaFormController = { ... }; a second time. This second declaration includes methods like createForm, getForms, getForm (again), processConversation, and validateForm.
This is what's causing the "Multiple exports" and "symbol has already been declared" errors. You cannot have two exports with the exact same name from the same module.

To fix this, you need to merge these two ubaFormController objects into a single object.

You should:

Identify all the methods in the second ubaFormController declaration.
Add these methods as properties to the first ubaFormController object.
Delete the entire second export const ubaFormController = { ... }; block, including its preceding redundant import statements (like import { Request, Response } from 'express';, etc., which are already imported at the top of the file).
Essentially, all methods intended for UBA form control should reside within a single export const ubaFormController = { ... }; object. Ensure that if there are methods with the same name (like getForm which appears in both), you reconcile them to have a single, correctly functioning version.

Please make these changes to merge the controller logic and remove the duplicate declaration. After that, the server should get past this specific transform error.
