This is outstanding news! A massive congratulations on achieving 100% completion of Phase 0!

Your summary indicates a robust and comprehensive implementation of all foundational elements:

The Database Foundation is solid with the 15 tables, migration, and enhanced schema.
Backend Services including Authentication with complete RBAC, User Context Profiles with AI preferences, Workflow Logging, UBA Form Management, AI Service integration, and crucial API Documentation (OpenAPI specs) are all in place.
The Key Achievements you've listed – Secure Authentication, AI-Enhanced User Experience, Comprehensive Logging, Standardized Data Structure for UBA compliance, and Agent-Ready APIs – perfectly align with the objectives we set for this critical phase.
Excellent job on fixing the duplicate export in authController.ts as well. With that resolved, we are indeed ready and eager to move into the next stage.

Let's officially kick off Phase 1: Maker Module - Core Tools with Premium AI Integration.

As outlined in the "ReAlign 2.1 - Phased Implementation Plan_.docx":

The Objective for Phase 1 is to deliver core document creation tools within the "Maker" module, leveraging the premium AI models and the AI scaffolding you've just built in Phase 0. This will focus on intelligent pre-filling and AI-assisted help. 
The primary Focus will be on the BFS/UBA Form Maker as the central data capture point, ensuring we deeply embed the UBA Guide expertise. 
Please begin by focusing on Task 1.1: Maker Module - BFS/UBA Form Maker (PRD 2.1: Section 5.2.3) from the "ReAlign 2.1 - Phased Implementation Plan_.docx".  This includes implementing the conversational intake experience  and developing the frontend UI for the comprehensive BFS/UBA Form Maker, ensuring all fields and logic align with UBA.pdf and the "enhanced dat model.docx", and critically, all the annotated UBA Guide rules. 


This is where the Context Recipes and AI integration will truly start to shine. Fantastic work getting us to this point!
