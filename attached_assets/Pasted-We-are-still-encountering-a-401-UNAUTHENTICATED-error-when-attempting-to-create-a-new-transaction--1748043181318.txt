We are still encountering a '401 UNAUTHENTICATED' error when attempting to create a new transaction, even after verifying Supabase URL, Anon Key, and Service Role Key in Replit Secrets. The goal is to make negotiator registration, login, and subsequent authenticated API calls (like transaction creation) work reliably as per the 'ReAlign_Tracker MVP - Phased Implementation Plan.docx' and 'ReAlign_Tracker MVP - Phased Implementation Plan II.docx'.

Please perform the following steps meticulously, verifying each stage. We will focus on ensuring the backend correctly validates JWTs and the frontend correctly sends them.

Phase 1: Backend Authentication Core - Verification and Refinement

server/config.ts - Environment Variable Loading (Verify):

Ensure process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and crucially process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are being correctly loaded into the config object.
Add console logs inside server/config.ts right after the config object is defined to print these loaded values (mask parts of keys for security in logs, e.g., console.log('Loaded SERVICE_KEY:', config.supabaseServiceRoleKey ? config.supabaseServiceRoleKey.substring(0, 5) + '...' : 'MISSING!');). This will confirm what values are actually being used at runtime.
server/lib/supabase.ts - Centralized Supabase Clients (Create/Verify):

If this file doesn't exist, create it.
Define and export two Supabase client instances:
supabaseAdmin: Initialized with config.supabaseUrl and config.supabaseServiceRoleKey. This client must be used for token validation (auth.getUser(token)) in middleware and any admin-level Supabase operations.
supabaseAuthClient: Initialized with config.supabaseUrl and config.supabaseAnonKey. This client should be used for user-facing auth operations like auth.signUp() and auth.signInWithPassword() in authController.ts.
Throw an error in this file if config.supabaseServiceRoleKey is missing.
server/middleware/auth.ts - Token Validation (Refine):

Import supabaseAdmin from server/lib/supabase.ts.
In authenticateJWT:
Use the supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser(token) method for token validation.
Add detailed console logging immediately before calling supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser(token):
Log the first few and last few characters of the received token to verify it's being passed correctly.
Log supabaseAdmin.auth.api.supabaseUrl to ensure the client is configured for the correct project.
If getUserError occurs, log its full error.message and error.status (if available) to understand why Supabase is rejecting the token.
Ensure req.user is populated with id, email, and role from supabaseUser.app_metadata.role.
server/controllers/authController.ts - Registration and Login (Refine):

Import and use supabaseAuthClient for signUp and signInWithPassword.
Import and use supabaseAdminClient (from server/lib/supabase.ts) specifically for admin.updateUserById to set app_metadata (role and name) immediately after a successful signUp. This step is critical for the JWT to contain the role.
In the login function, ensure the token returned to the frontend is signInData.session.access_token. Also, consider returning signInData.session.refresh_token if you plan for the frontend to use supabase.auth.setSession().
Add logging for any errors during signUp, signInWithPassword, or admin.updateUserById.
Phase 2: Frontend Authentication Core - Verification

client/src/lib/supabase.ts - Frontend Supabase Client (Verify):

Ensure it initializes with import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL and import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.
Add console logs to verify these VITE_ variables are correctly loaded in the browser.
client/src/context/AuthContext.tsx - Token Management (Verify):

signIn function:
After fetching the token from /api/v1/auth/login, ensure localStorage.setItem('auth_token', data.token) is correctly storing the access_token received.
Consider (Optional but Recommended for Robustness): After successfully receiving the access_token (and refresh_token if you updated the backend to send it), call supabase.auth.setSession({ access_token: data.token, refresh_token: data.refresh_token }) from the frontend Supabase client instance. This makes the client instance explicitly aware of the session.
useEffect for onAuthStateChange and getSession:
Verify that if a session is found or a SIGNED_IN event occurs, localStorage.setItem('auth_token', session.access_token) is called and the user state is updated correctly by fetching from /api/v1/auth/me (using the new token).
Add console logs to trace token storage and user state updates.
client/src/lib/queryClient.ts - API Request Authorization (Verify):

Confirm that apiRequest correctly retrieves auth_token from localStorage and sets the Authorization: Bearer <token> header. Add a log here to see the token being sent (first few chars).
Phase 3: Testing and Iteration

Clear State:
Delete all users from the Supabase Auth dashboard again.
Clear any relevant user entries from your public.users table in the PostgreSQL database.
Clear browser localStorage and application cache for your Replit app's domain.
Test Registration:
Attempt to register a new negotiator.
Monitor backend console logs from config.ts, authController.ts (for signUp and admin.updateUserById), and your database for user creation.
Check Supabase dashboard: user created in Auth? app_metadata.role and app_metadata.name set? Email confirmed (if applicable)?
Test Login:
Attempt to log in with the new negotiator.
Monitor backend console logs from authController.ts (signInWithPassword) and frontend logs from AuthContext.tsx (token storage).
Check the auth_token stored in localStorage in the browser.
Test Protected Route (e.g., Transaction Creation):
Attempt to create a new transaction.
Monitor frontend console for the token being sent in queryClient.ts.
Monitor backend console for logs from authenticateJWT middleware (token received, Supabase client URL, any getUser errors).
If 401 persists, closely examine the token strings (partial logs) and error messages from supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser(token).
Provide the exact changes for each file. If any of these steps reveal a specific error or misconfiguration, focus on fixing that before moving to the next. The goal is to achieve a successful negotiator login that results in a valid JWT that the backend middleware can successfully validate, allowing access to protected routes like transaction creation."

This prompt is designed to be very methodical, starting from the most fundamental configuration (Supabase keys) and moving through the token lifecycle. The emphasis on console logging at critical junctures should help pinpoint where the process is breaking down.
