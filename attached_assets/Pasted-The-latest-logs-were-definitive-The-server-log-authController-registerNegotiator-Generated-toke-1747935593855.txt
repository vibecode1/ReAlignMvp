The latest logs were definitive!
- The server log `authController.registerNegotiator: Generated token = No token available` confirms `authData.session?.access_token` is undefined after `supabase.auth.signUp()`.
- The client log `apiRequest: Token retrieved from localStorage = "undefined..."` shows the direct result of this.
- The server middleware then correctly rejects "Bearer undefined".

Furthermore, I received an email from Supabase about a high rate of bounced emails for project `mivndfxqoixwnyoftvtw`, which strongly suggests that "Email Confirmation" is currently ENABLED in my Supabase project's Authentication settings. This would explain why `signUp()` doesn't immediately return an active session token.

Please help me with the following:

1.  **Confirm Supabase Email Confirmation Setting (Guidance for me):**
    * Please remind me where I can check and change the "Enable email confirmations" setting within my Supabase project dashboard (Authentication -> Settings or similar).

2.  **Strategy Based on Email Confirmation Setting:**
    * **For current development and to get the immediate post-registration redirect working as originally intended, I would like to temporarily turn OFF "Enable email confirmations" in my Supabase project settings.**
    * Once I confirm I have turned this setting OFF in Supabase, what should we test next? Should the existing code in `authController.registerNegotiator` then correctly receive an `access_token` from `supabase.auth.signUp()`?

3.  **Add Final Diagnostic Log (If Not Already Present):**
    * Please ensure this log is present in `server/controllers/authController.ts` *immediately after* the `supabase.auth.signUp` call, to help confirm the result in the next test:
        `console.log('authController.registerNegotiator: Full authData from Supabase signUp:', authData);`
        (This will show us the structure of `authData` and specifically if `authData.session` becomes available once email confirmation is off).

My immediate goal is to achieve a successful registration that logs the user in and redirects them to the dashboard. We can revisit enabling email confirmation and adjusting the app flow for it later.
