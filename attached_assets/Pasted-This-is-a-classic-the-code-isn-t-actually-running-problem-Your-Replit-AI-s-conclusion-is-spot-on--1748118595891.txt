This is a classic "the code isn't actually running" problem! Your Replit AI's conclusion is spot on. The absence of your most basic console.log statements (Log A: "About to define POST route" and Log D: "Successfully defined POST route") is the smoking gun. It means the JavaScript engine never even sees those lines of code in server/routes.ts.

Therefore, the issue is not with Express.js routing logic (like pattern matching or middleware order) but one level higher: the Node.js environment (or the Replit run environment) is not loading or executing the updated version of your server/routes.ts file.

Here's what to do, based on the Replit AI's "Most Likely Causes":

Hard Restart/Re-run the Server in Replit:

This is the most common fix for this scenario. Find the "Stop" button for your server process in Replit and then "Run" it again. This forces Node.js to re-read all project files from disk.
Why: Many Node.js server setups, especially in development with tools like nodemon (or similar watchers Replit might use), are supposed to auto-reload on file changes. However, sometimes this mechanism can glitch, or it might not be configured for all file types or directories. A manual restart is the most reliable way to ensure the latest code is loaded.
Check for Syntax Errors (Less Likely if Other Routes Work, but Possible):

If there was a syntax error introduced only in the new code block for the POST /:id/parties route (or around it) within server/routes.ts, it could theoretically cause part of the file to not be parsed correctly, or the whole module loading to fail silently in some edge cases (though usually Node.js will complain loudly in the console).
Action: Carefully review the exact changes you made in server/routes.ts for any typos, unmatched brackets/parentheses, missing commas, etc., especially around the new route definition. Even a small syntax error can halt the execution of a module.
Verify File Saving in Replit:

Ensure that your changes to server/routes.ts were actually saved in the Replit editor. Sometimes, there can be a lag or an issue where the editor content doesn't immediately sync to the underlying file system the server is running from.
Action: Make a trivial, visible change (like adding a prominent comment), save explicitly, and then restart the server.
Check Replit's Build/Cache Mechanisms (If Applicable):

While less common for typical Node.js/Express setups, if Replit has any specific build process or caching layer for server-side TypeScript files, it might be serving a stale version. A hard restart usually clears this.
You are using TypeScript. Ensure that the TypeScript compilation process (if you're not using a direct TypeScript runner like ts-node or if Replit handles it behind the scenes) is completing successfully and outputting the updated JavaScript to the correct location that Node.js is running. Look at your tsconfig.json and how your npm start or Replit run command is configured in package.json.
In summary, the immediate and most crucial step is to forcefully restart your Replit server environment.

If, after a full server restart, the "Log A" (!!! TRANSACTION ROUTER DEBUG: About to define POST /:id/parties route) still doesn't appear in your console when the server starts up (it should appear once during the server initialization phase as the routes.ts module is loaded), then the problem is deeper, potentially related to:

The server/routes.ts file itself not being imported or used by your main server entry point (server/index.ts or similar).
A critical syntax error earlier in the server/routes.ts file that prevents the entire file from being parsed and executed.
But start with the server restart. That's overwhelmingly the most likely solution when debug logs at the definition-level of code don't even appear.
