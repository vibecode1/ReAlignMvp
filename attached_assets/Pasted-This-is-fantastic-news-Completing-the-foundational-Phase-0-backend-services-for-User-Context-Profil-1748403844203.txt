This is fantastic news! Completing the foundational Phase 0 backend services for User Context Profile APIs, the Structured Workflow Logging Engine, Normalized BFS/UBA Data APIs, and the Context Recipe Framework, all on top of the enhanced storage layer, is a major step forward. The details you've provided (like specific tracking capabilities and UBA Guide compliance integration) demonstrate a thorough implementation.

The foundation indeed looks solid for completing the rest of Phase 0. Your suggested next steps are well aligned with the remaining tasks. Let's proceed with them, with a slight clarification on order and one addition:

Confirm Core User Authentication & RBAC Stubs (Task 0.1):

Before we dive deeper into "RBAC Enhancement," please ensure the fundamental user registration, login, and basic profile management for Homeowner, Negotiator, and Agent roles are fully functional, and that the initial RBAC stubs (defining roles and basic permission checks) from Task 0.1 are operational. This is the bedrock for everything else.
OpenAPI Specifications (Task 0.6):

Yes, please begin creating the OpenAPI specifications for all the backend APIs you've just implemented (User Context, Logging, UBA Data). This is a key part of the Agent Experience (AX) Foundation.
AI Service Integration (Task 0.5):

Proceed with configuring and testing connectivity to the premium AI services (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo, Claude Sonnet) using the API keys managed in Replit Secrets.
Context Capture Integration (Logging - Task 0.3):

Absolutely, start integrating logging calls to your new /api/v1/workflow-log/events endpoint. This should happen at relevant points in any existing workflows and within the business logic of the new backend services you've built. This is critical for capturing the data needed for AI and analytics.
RBAC Enhancement for New APIs (Refinement of Task 0.1 & applying to new APIs):

Once core authentication is confirmed, extend the RBAC framework to ensure all the newly created APIs (User Context Profile, Structured Workflow Logging, Normalized BFS/UBA Data) are properly protected, enforcing the defined roles and permissions.
Basic Onboarding for User Context Capture (Part of Task 0.2):

Implement the basic onboarding step (e.g., during registration or first login) to capture the initial MVP context fields for the User Context Profile, utilizing the APIs you've built.
Addressing these items will round out the core backend and foundational AI scaffolding for Phase 0. Great job, and let's keep the momentum going!
