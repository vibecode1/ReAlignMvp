Thank you for making the changes to `authController.ts` that allow the registration and login UI flow to proceed by relying solely on Supabase Auth for now.

However, as we've discussed, for ReAlignMVP to function correctly with its own business logic (like managing trial periods, user-specific data, and relationships to transactions), the application's own PostgreSQL database **must be fully operational and integrated.**

The core issue remains the database connectivity problem (initially "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND db.mivndfxqoixwnyoftvtw.supabase.co", and then ensuring the new Replit-provisioned Neon database is correctly set up and used).

Please prioritize the following steps to achieve a stable and functional application database:

1.  **DATABASE_URL Confirmation:**
    * Confirm that the `DATABASE_URL` **secret** in Replit is accurately configured for the **Replit-provisioned PostgreSQL database** (hosted at `ep-icy-field-a6ovomt1.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech`). Please verify the host, port, user, password, and database name are all correct in this connection string.

2.  **Drizzle Configuration (`drizzle.config.ts`):**
    * Ensure `drizzle.config.ts` correctly uses the `DATABASE_URL` from the Replit secrets for running migrations.

3.  **Successful Database Migration (`npm run db:push`):**
    * Execute `npm run db:push` again. This command **MUST complete successfully**.
    * If it fails, provide the **full error output**. We need to resolve any schema or migration issues with this new database. This is a critical blocking point.

4.  **Runtime Database Client Verification (`server/storage.ts`, `server/config.ts`):**
    * After confirming the `DATABASE_URL` secret and successful migration, verify that the application code (likely in `server/storage.ts` or where the Drizzle client is initialized for runtime use) is correctly and successfully connecting to this Replit-provisioned PostgreSQL database using the `DATABASE_URL` from secrets. We need to be sure the `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND` or any other connection error is resolved at runtime.

5.  **Test Database Write (`storage.createUser`):**
    * Once steps 1-4 are confirmed, we need to test if `storage.createUser` can actually write to the Replit-provisioned database. If you have a test script or can temporarily add a test route to trigger this, that would be ideal.

**After these steps are completed and we have confirmation that the application can connect to and write to its own PostgreSQL database reliably:**

6.  **Revert Temporary Changes in `authController.ts`:**
    * In `registerNegotiator`: Restore the `try...catch` block for `await storage.createUser(...)`. The function should return a `DATABASE_ERROR` if `storage.createUser` fails. The user object in the success response must come from the record successfully created in our database by `storage.createUser`.
    * In `login`: Restore the database lookup (e.g., `await storage.getUserByEmail(email)`).
    * In `getCurrentUser`: Restore the database lookup (e.g., `await storage.getUserById(req.user.id)`).

Our goal is a fully integrated application database, not just a bypass. Let's focus on fixing the database connection and integration first.
