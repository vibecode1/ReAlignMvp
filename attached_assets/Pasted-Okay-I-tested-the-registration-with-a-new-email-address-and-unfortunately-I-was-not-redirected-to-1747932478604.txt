Okay, I tested the registration with a new email address, and unfortunately, I was not redirected to the dashboard. I remained on the registration page.

We need to debug what's happening on the client-side (`client/src/pages/RegisterNegotiator.tsx`) and check the immediate server response.

Please help me by:

1.  **Verifying Client-Side Logs in `RegisterNegotiator.tsx`:**
    * Ensure the `console.log` statements we previously discussed are still active in the `onSubmit` function in `client/src/pages/RegisterNegotiator.tsx`. Specifically, we need to see logs for:
        * The API response: `console.log('Registration API response:', response);`
        * After `localStorage` and `supabase.auth.setSession` calls: `console.log('Token, user, and Supabase session set');` (or similar)
        * Immediately before the redirect: `console.log('Attempting to redirect to /dashboard');`
        * Any errors caught in the `catch` block: `console.error('Registration error in catch block:', error);`

2.  **Inspecting Browser Developer Tools During Registration:**
    * After I attempt registration again (and it fails to redirect), please check the browser's developer tools and report back on:
        * **Console Tab:**
            * Are the `console.log` messages from step 1 appearing? What do they show?
            * Are there *any other* JavaScript errors or warnings?
        * **Network Tab:**
            * Find the `/api/v1/auth/register-negotiator` request.
            * What is its **Status Code** (e.g., 201, 400, 500)?
            * What is the **full JSON response body** from this request?
            * Are there any other network requests that seem to fail or behave unexpectedly immediately after this one (e.g., a call to `/api/v1/auth/me` that might be failing and causing `AuthContext` to sign out)?

3.  **Checking Server Logs (Replit Console):**
    * Simultaneously, please check the Replit server logs for any errors or relevant log messages that occur *during this specific registration attempt*. Pay attention to:
        * Logs from `authController.registerNegotiator` (e.g., "User successfully saved to database:" or any `dbError` logs if `storage.createUser` failed).
        * Logs from any subsequent calls, like `authController.getCurrentUser` if `/api/v1/auth/me` is being hit.

We need to pinpoint if the issue is:
    a. The API call itself is failing (and why).
    b. The API call succeeds, but an error occurs in the client-side `try` block before `setLocation` is called.
    c. `setLocation` is called, but the routing or authentication state (`AuthContext.tsx`) is preventing the redirect or immediately redirecting back.
