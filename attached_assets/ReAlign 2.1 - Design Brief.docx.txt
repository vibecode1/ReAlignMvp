ReAlign 2.1 - Design Brief
Date: May, 27, 2025
Version: 2.1
1. What is it? It’s a loan modification (or short sale) SaaS platform that helps distressed homeowners prepare, submit, and track their loss mitigation applications with their mortgage servicers. The platform automates paperwork, provides expert-backed guidance, and helps users stay organized in their fight to keep their homes.
2. Who is it for?
* Primary Audience: Homeowners who are behind on their mortgage and at risk of foreclosure.
* Secondary Audience: Housing counselors, foreclosure attorneys, and nonprofits assisting homeowners.
Pain Points:
* Confusing, bureaucratic process
* Banks losing paperwork or giving conflicting information
* Fear of making mistakes that lead to denial
* Expensive legal fees for loan modification services
Value Proposition:
* 🔹 Empowers homeowners to take control of their mortgage situation without expensive attorneys
* 🔹 Automates the complex paperwork process with lender-specific forms
* 🔹 Ensures completeness & compliance to reduce denial risks
* 🔹 Tracks communication with servicers to prevent delays
* 🔹 Built by experts with real foreclosure prevention experience
1. Color
* Primary Color: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) → Trust, stability, and professionalism.
* Secondary Colors:
   * Teal/Green (#2D6A4F, #2CA58D) → Represents hope, financial recovery.
   * Muted Orange/Gold (#E76F51, #F4A261) → Used for CTAs, adding urgency without stress.
* ✅ Avoid: Bright red (anxiety), neon colors (feels scammy), excessive black (too corporate).
2. Typography
* Primary Font: Inter, Roboto, or Open Sans (clean, modern, readable).
* Hierarchy:
   * H1 (Headers): Bold and large (e.g., 32px+ for key headings).
   * H2 (Subheaders): Slightly smaller, maintaining clear separation.
   * Body Text: Legible at 16px+, with good line height (1.5x).
   * Forms & Labels: Clear and readable, no tiny text.
* ✅ Keep it simple: No decorative or highly stylized fonts.
3. Iconography & Imagery
* Icons: Use clean, minimal SVG icons (e.g., Material Icons, Heroicons).
* Illustrations: Use flat vector graphics to explain complex processes (like document uploads, servicer communications).
* Photography: Real, relatable homeowners (avoid fake stock images).
* ✅ Goal: Icons should support navigation, not overwhelm.
4. Elements (Inputs, Buttons, etc.)
* Buttons:
   * Primary CTA: Deep Blue (e.g., “Submit My Application”)
   * Secondary CTA: Teal/Green (e.g., “Learn More”)
   * Disabled: Light gray (clear state differentiation)
* Forms:
   * Clear field labels (not just placeholders).
   * Auto-formatting for common fields (phone numbers, dates).
   * Error states in soft red, not aggressive warning colors.
* Progress Indicators: Users should always know where they are in the process.
* ✅ Rule: Every interactive element must have a clear purpose.
* Conversational Intake UI Pattern
   * A global persistent chat window is available throughout the platform, guiding users through complex workflows using plain language. It supports document uploads, displays extracted information, and provides inline editing of structured summaries. The visual tone remains calm, clear, and lightly animated. The assistant is styled in alignment with primary ReAlign colors (Deep Blue, Teal, Muted Orange) and avoids overly robotic or flashy interaction.
5. Containers & Spacing
* Padding & Margins: Minimum 16px padding inside cards/forms.
* Content Width:
   * Mobile (320-576px): Full-width inputs.
   * Tablet (768px+): Use a max width (e.g., 600-800px for better readability).
   * Desktop (992px+): Content in a structured 12-column grid (Bootstrap).
* Whitespace: Intentional breathing room to avoid overwhelming users.
* ✅ Key Principle: Less clutter, more clarity.
6. States, Interaction & Motion
* Hover States: Buttons slightly darken or shift (no aggressive animations).
* Loading Indicators: Subtle spinner or progress bar (no sudden blank screens).
* Form Validation: Inline hints (e.g., green checkmarks for correct inputs).
* Microinteractions: Smooth transitions for modals, expanding sections (not flashy).
* ✅ Best Practice: Motion should guide, not distract.
7. Summary Your loan modification SaaS UI should be:
* ✅ Calm & Trustworthy (Deep blues, structured typography).
* ✅ Clear & Actionable (Guided UI, well-defined buttons).
* ✅ Optimized for Stress-Free Use (Simple inputs, reassuring messaging).
1. How can I reinforce my brand?
* Consistency in Visual Identity: Stick to a primary deep blue color scheme (trust & stability) with green (hope & progress) and muted orange (call-to-action) accents.
* Typography & Layout: Use clean, readable fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or Open Sans) with a well-structured UI that avoids clutter.
* Trust Signals: Incorporate case studies, testimonials, and references to real legal expertise (e.g., Nadia Kilburn’s guidance).
* Messaging Alignment: Every piece of content should communicate empowerment and clarity, ensuring users feel in control of their situation.
2. What’s our tone of voice?
* Empathetic & Reassuring: Understand that homeowners are under stress, so your messaging should be supportive yet direct.
* Authoritative Yet Approachable: You're offering a professional legal-backed service, but it should not feel overly corporate or rigid.
* Action-Oriented: Instead of fear-driven messaging, frame it around "taking control of your mortgage situation" with clear next steps.
* Avoid Jargon: Break down complex legal and mortgage terms into plain, easy-to-understand language.
3. How do we handle null data?
* Helpful Defaults: If a field has no data, provide smart defaults (e.g., "No documents uploaded yet. Here's what you need next.")
* Guided Prompts: Instead of blank screens, use placeholders like, “It looks like you haven’t uploaded your bank statements yet. Let’s fix that!”
* Encourage Action: Use subtle nudges, like a progress tracker, to show users how much they’ve completed and what remains.
* Error Prevention: Instead of just showing an error, proactively guide users (e.g., “We couldn’t process this document. Try uploading a PDF or clear image.”)
4. Photography or Illustrations?
* Illustrations for Explanations: Since legal processes can be intimidating, use simple vector-style illustrations to explain steps visually.
* Photography for Trust: Use real-life imagery (not generic stock photos) in testimonials and case studies to humanize the experience.
* Hybrid Approach: Combine illustrated step-by-step guides with real photos of homeowners and experts to build emotional connection.
5. How shall we handle app notifications?
* Critical Alerts (Urgent Actions Needed)
   * Email + App Notification
   * Example: "Your servicer has requested additional documents. Submit them by [date] to avoid delays."
* Reminders & Follow-ups
   * In-app pop-ups and scheduled email reminders (e.g., “You haven’t submitted your hardship letter yet. Need help writing one?”)
* Milestones & Encouragement
   * Celebrate user progress (e.g., “You're 75% done! Just one more step to submit your application.”)
* Non-Intrusive UX
   * Avoid overwhelming users—give them options to customize notification preferences.

* Improve heading-to-body hierarchy by balancing weights, spacing, and co
