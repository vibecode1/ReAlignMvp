Okay, the latest test provided critical clues! Here's a summary:
- Server-side registration is successful: `/api/v1/auth/register-negotiator` returns 201, and the server logs "User successfully saved to database: rkilburn11@gmail.com".
- Client-side registration in `RegisterNegotiator.tsx` completes all steps, including `supabase.auth.setSession()` and the `window.location.href = '/dashboard'` call.
- Browser console shows navigation to `/dashboard`.
- **Crucially, `AuthContext.tsx` then calls `/api/v1/auth/me`, but this request gets a 404 Not Found response (confirmed in the browser's Network Tab).**
- This 404 causes `AuthContext.tsx` to sign the user out, preventing access to the dashboard.

We need to find out why `/api/v1/auth/me` (handled by `authController.getCurrentUser`) is returning a 404 for a user that was just successfully saved.

Please make the following changes to help debug:

1.  **Add Detailed Logging to `server/controllers/authController.ts` -> `getCurrentUser` function:**
    * Right at the beginning of `getCurrentUser`, log that the function was entered.
    * Log the entire `req.user` object (or at least `req.user.id` and `req.user.email`) that is being provided by the `auth` middleware. This will show us the ID being used for the lookup.
    * Log the `id` value just before calling `await storage.getUserById(id)`.
    * Log the raw `user` object returned by `await storage.getUserById(id)` *before* the `if (!user)` check.
    * Add a specific log message if the `if (!user)` condition (that returns the 404) is met, e.g., `console.error('User not found in database with ID:', req.user.id);`.

2.  **Add Logging to the `auth` Middleware (`server/middleware/auth.ts`):**
    * Log the token being received from the `Authorization` header.
    * Log the `user` object or `id` from the decoded Supabase JWT *before* it's attached to `req.user`.

3.  **Add Logging to `server/storage.ts` -> `getUserById` function:**
    * Log the `id` parameter it receives.
    * Log the exact SQL query being constructed and executed by Drizzle (if possible, or at least the parameters used).
    * Log the raw result returned from the database query.

After these logging additions, I will test registration again. We need to see the flow of the user ID from the JWT, through the middleware, into `getCurrentUser`, and into `storage.getUserById` to understand why the user isn't being found by ID right after being created.
