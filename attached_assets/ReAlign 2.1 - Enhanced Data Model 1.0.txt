ReAlign - Enhanced Data Model Date: May, 27, 2025 Version: 1.0 (Updated with UBA Guide Annotations and Conversational Intake Fields)
How an AI Coding Agent Can Interpret This Format: Entities (Main Data Types): Headings starting with ### (e.g., ### Transaction ) clearly define distinct data entities or tables. Fields: Bullet points ( - ) under each entity define the fields (attributes or columns) for that entity. Field Names: The text immediately following the bullet point is the field name (e.g., File Number ). Data Types: The text within parentheses () specifies the data type (e.g., (text) , (date) , (number) , (yes/no) for boolean). Option Sets (Enums): Fields like (option set: Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, Other) indicate an enumerated type. The AI can parse the options. A separate "Option Sets" section further clarifies these. Relationships (Links): Fields like (link to Party) indicate a foreign key relationship to another entity. The "Relationships" section provides a summary of these connections. Annotations/Metadata: Text in square brackets [] like [NEW - UBA] or [NEW - CRM] provides context or source information for the field, which can be useful for understanding requirements but might be ignored for pure schema generation. Additional annotations marked [UBA Guide: ...] have been added to provide context from the "how to fill out borrower assistance form.docx". Comments/Notes: Sections like "Overview" and "Implementation Notes" provide broader context. An AI agent can parse this structure to: Generate database schema definitions (e.g., SQL DDL). Create ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) models/classes. Scaffold basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints. Inform the creation of data entry forms in a UI. While this format is very good for AI understanding, for highly automated, direct machine processing (like a script that ingests a schema and outputs code without LLM interpretation), a format like JSON Schema or YAML would be even more explicit and less prone to parsing ambiguities. However, for an LLM-based AI coding agent, the provided Markdown is effective. Here is the data model again, formatted for clarity:
