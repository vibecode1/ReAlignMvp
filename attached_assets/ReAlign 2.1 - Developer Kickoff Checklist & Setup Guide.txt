   * Agent authentication testing setup
III. Phase 0 Kickoff Specifics (Illustrative - Adapt for Current Phase) This section should be updated/reviewed at the start of each new major phase outlined in the Implementation Plan.
* A. Live vs. Mocked Services for Phase 0:
   * User Authentication (Live): Needs to be functional for basic platform access.
   * Database (Live): Essential for storing User Context, Logs, and Normalized Data (including UBA-related structures) from Day 1 of Phase 0.
   * Premium AI Services (Live Setup, Limited Usage): While full AI features launch in Phase 1, the APIs and Context Recipe framework should be configured and tested in Phase 0. Cost monitoring is essential from Day 1.
   * Context Recipe Framework (Live): Core infrastructure for defining and tracking what contextual data feeds into AI prompts (including future UBA Guide rules) must be established in Phase 0.
* B. Seeded Data Requirements for Phase 0/1:
   * [ ] User Roles: Ensure "Homeowner," "Negotiator," "Agent" roles are definable or pre-seeded in the database.
   * [ ] Test Users: Create at least one test user for each role to facilitate E2E testing of Phase 0 deliverables (registration, login, basic profile).
   * [ ] Context Recipe Templates: Create initial Context Recipe definitions for planned Phase 1 AI features, anticipating the need to incorporate UBA Guide logic.
   * [ ] (Optional) Sample Case Data: For testing logging related to "Case Creation," a mechanism to create a dummy case might be needed, or this can be the first E2E test.
* C. Parallelizable vs. Dependent Tasks for Phase 0:
   * Can be Parallelized (Illustrative):
      * Backend schema design for User Context Profile (0.2) can occur alongside schema design for Logging Engine (0.3) and Normalization Layer (0.4) (ensuring UBA data structure needs are met).
      * Context Recipe framework design (0.2) can be developed in parallel with premium AI service integration (0.5).
      * Frontend stubs for navigation and basic UI shell (0.5) can be worked on while backend APIs for Phase 0 are being developed.
   * Key Dependencies:
      * User Authentication (0.1) is a prerequisite for testing most other Phase 0 features requiring user context.
      * Database setup and ORM configuration (0.5) are prerequisites for all data storage tasks (0.2, 0.3, 0.4).
      * Context Recipe framework (0.2) must be established before implementing any AI features in Phase 1 (this framework will house UBA Guide rule logic).
      * Premium AI service configuration (0.5) is a prerequisite for Phase 1 AI integrations (which will assist with UBA form completion).
      * Backend APIs for each scaffolding component generally need to be in place before heavy frontend integration.
IV. General Development & AI Builder Guidance
* Modularity: Emphasize building features in clearly defined, modular components. This is critical for Replit AI to generate manageable code chunks and for human review/integration.
* Clarity of Prompts (for Replit AI):
   * Reference specific tasks from the "ReAlign 2.1 - Phased Implementation Plan (latest version)."
   * Provide explicit schemas, API contracts, UI element descriptions, and expected behaviors for each task given to the AI.
   * Include Context Recipe specifications, especially those incorporating UBA Guide logic for relevant forms, when implementing AI features.
   * Specify premium AI model requirements and cost considerations for each feature.
* Premium AI Integration Best Practices:
   * Don't optimize for cost in early phases - prioritize user experience quality over API call efficiency, especially for complex UBA form assistance.
   * Implement comprehensive logging for all AI interactions including context used (e.g., specific UBA rule applied), user satisfaction, and cost tracking.
   * Build Context Recipes first before implementing AI features - define exactly what data (including UBA Guide rules) feeds into each AI prompt.
   * Test with premium models from the start rather than building up from basic models.
* Error Handling & Loading States: Implement robust error handling and clear loading state indicators from the beginning for any asynchronous operations, especially for AI service calls which may have higher latency. Refer to "ReAlign 2.0 UI & Navigation - Implementation Guide.docx" for best practices.
* UI Consistency: Adhere to the "Early Definition of Standard UI Affordances for AI Features" (from Implementation Plan, Cross-Phase Considerations). Use tailwind.config.ts for theme consistency. Ensure AI-generated content (e.g., pre-filled UBA fields) is clearly marked and easily editable.
* Context Recipe Implementation:
   * Document each Context Recipe with clear specifications of data sources and contextual parameters (including UBA Guide rules).
   * Implement Context Recipe tracking in the logging system to measure effectiveness, particularly for UBA form assistance.
   * Make Context Recipes reusable across similar AI features.
   * Version Control Context Recipes as they evolve based on user feedback and UBA Guide clarifications.
* Testing:
   * Write unit tests for new backend logic.
   * Perform manual E2E testing for each feature as it's completed within a phase.
   * Test AI features with realistic context data, including scenarios covered by the UBA Guide, to ensure Context Recipes work as intended.
   * Monitor AI interaction quality and cost metrics during testing.
   * (For Replit AI) Request generation of basic test stubs where applicable.
* Security: Keep security principles (input validation, parameterized queries, RBAC enforcement) in mind for all new code. Pay special attention to AI service API key security and data privacy when sending context (like UBA form data) to external AI services.
* Code Reviews: If humans are integrating AI-generated code, ensure a review process. Include Context Recipe (especially UBA rule logic) and AI integration review as part of code review process.
* Regular Commits: Commit work regularly with clear messages. Include Context Recipe changes and AI feature implementations (including UBA logic) in commit messages.
V. AI-Specific Development Guidelines (New Section)
* Context Recipe Development:
   * [ ] Define Context Recipe first before implementing any AI feature.
   * [ ] Document data sources required for each Context Recipe (User Context Profile, normalized data including UBA details, workflow logs, etc.).
   * [ ] Specify contextual parameters (user role, current page, case status, UBA form section, etc.).
   * [ ] Include historical context requirements (previous interactions, AI responses, user modifications to UBA fields).
   * [ ] Define success metrics for each Context Recipe (user satisfaction with UBA assistance, task completion, escalation rates).
* Premium AI Model Integration:
   * [ ] Configure multiple premium AI providers for redundancy (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
   * [ ] Implement model selection logic based on task requirements (e.g., complexity of UBA rule) and cost considerations.
   * [ ] Set up usage monitoring and cost alerting from Day 1.
   * [ ] Plan for graceful degradation if premium models become unavailable.
* AI Feature Implementation Standards:
   * [ ] Clear AI content marking - users must know when content (e.g., in UBA form) is AI-generated.
   * [ ] Easy user override - all AI suggestions (e.g., pre-filled UBA fields) must be easily editable.
   * [ ] Seamless escalation paths - clear options to get human help when AI is insufficient for UBA queries.
   * [ ] Comprehensive logging - track all AI interactions, context used (including UBA rules), and user responses.
* Avoiding Over-Engineering:
   * [ ] Don't build complex fallback systems for current AI model limitations when assisting with UBA form.
   * [ ] Avoid custom parsing logic for UBA data that premium models can handle directly.
   * [ ] Skip redundant prompt engineering workarounds - use premium model capabilities instead.
   * [ ] Focus on data structure (informed by "enhanced dat model.docx" with UBA annotations) and UX rather than compensating for AI weaknesses.
* Cost Management Strategy:
   * [ ] Monitor costs from first AI implementation (e.g., UBA field help) but don't optimize prematurely.
   * [ ] Track cost per user interaction to understand unit economics of UBA assistance.
   * [ ] Implement usage alerts to prevent unexpected cost spikes.
   * [ ] Plan cost optimization strategy for when user base scales.
VI. Phase-Specific AI Considerations
* Phase 1: Premium AI Integration
   * [ ] Focus on Ferrari-level AI experiences for UBA form field help and document generation reflecting UBA Guide rules.
   * [ ] Implement comprehensive Context Recipes for BFS/UBA and LOE features, deeply embedding UBA Guide logic.
   * [ ] Remove planned fallback systems - rely on premium model capabilities for UBA assistance.
   * [ ] Budget for high per-user AI costs in favor of superior user experience for UBA form completion.
* Phase 2: AI Chatbot & Review Console
   * [ ] Deploy premium conversational AI models for the chatbot, trained with UBA Guide knowledge.
   * [ ] Build expert review tools for AI interaction quality management, including AI's application of UBA rules.
   * [ ] Track Context Recipe effectiveness for UBA queries through the review console.
   * [ ] Optimize Knowledge Base based on premium AI interaction patterns related to UBA questions.
* Phase 3: Predictive Intelligence
   * [ ] Use premium AI for pattern recognition rather than simple heuristic rules, especially for alerts related to UBA form data.
   * [ ] Implement intelligent case analysis using comprehensive context from all modules, including UBA completion status and data.
   * [ ] Generate personalized insights rather than generic alerts.
* Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimization
   * [ ] Develop cost optimization strategies for UBA assistance as user base grows.
   * [ ] Implement tiered AI experiences if needed for scalability.
   * [ ] Build proprietary AI capabilities using accumulated data from UBA form interactions.
* Agent-Native Development Guidelines

   * Agent persona definitions for testing
   * API endpoint documentation standards
   * Semantic metadata requirements
   * Agent interaction logging specifications
VII. Success Metrics & Monitoring Setup
   * [ ] AI Interaction Quality Tracking:
   * User satisfaction ratings for AI features (especially UBA form assistance).
   * AI suggestion acceptance/modification/rejection rates for UBA fields.
   * Escalation rates from AI to human help for UBA queries.
   * Task completion times with AI assistance for UBA form.
   * [ ] Cost Monitoring:
   * Cost per user per AI interaction (e.g., per UBA field help).
   * Total AI service costs by feature.
   * Cost efficiency trends over time.
   * Budget alert thresholds.
   * [ ] Context Recipe Effectiveness:
   * Which Context Recipes (incorporating UBA Guide rules) produce the best user outcomes for UBA form completion.
   * Context data completeness and accuracy for UBA assistance.
   * Context Recipe usage patterns.
   * Improvement in AI responses with better context for UBA queries.
   * [ ] Competitive Advantage Metrics:
   * User preference for ReAlign AI vs. generic tools for UBA form assistance.
   * Task completion success rates for UBA form.
   * User retention correlated with AI feature usage.
   * Expert feedback on AI assistance quality for UBA form.
This checklist should be treated as a living document and updated as the project progresses through its phases. The emphasis on premium AI experiences while small, Context Recipe frameworks (rich with UBA Guide logic), and avoiding over-engineered solutions reflects the strategic approach needed to build a defensible AI-native platform in the loss mitigation space.
