Hello! Let's focus on resolving the backend issues preventing transaction creation. Your previous analysis was very helpful.

Please prioritize the following steps, using the "ReAlign_Tracker MVP - Phased Implementation Plan.docx" (contentFetchId: "uploaded:ReAlign_Tracker MVP - Phased Implementation Plan.docx") as the primary source of truth for all schema definitions, column names, and expected backend logic, especially details found in Phase 0 and Phase 1:

1.  **Correct SQL Syntax Errors:**
    * Identify and fix all SQL syntax errors (like "syntax error at or near '='") in the storage layer queries. Ensure all SQL is valid for PostgreSQL.

2.  **Align Storage Layer with Schema:**
    * Review and update the storage interface (`server/storage.ts`) and its Drizzle ORM implementation to perfectly match the Tracker MVP schema defined in "ReAlign_Tracker MVP - Phased Implementation Plan.docx"[cite: 1]. This includes:
        * Correct table names: `transactions`, `transaction_phase_history`[cite: 1], `doc_requests`[cite: 1], `doc_uploads`[cite: 1], `tracker_notes`[cite: 1], `email_subscriptions`[cite: 1].
        * Correct column names and types for each table as specified (e.g., `property_address`, `title`, `current_phase_key`, `negotiator_id` in `transactions`[cite: 1]; `transaction_id`, `phase_key`, `timestamp`, `set_by_negotiator_id` in `transaction_phase_history`[cite: 1], etc.).
        * Ensure Drizzle ORM configurations (`drizzle.config.ts`) are correctly set up and any necessary migrations are planned/executed to reflect these schema changes[cite: 1].

3.  **Update Backend Controllers:**
    * Modify all relevant backend controllers (especially `server/controllers/transactionController.ts`, and any others interacting with the database for transaction creation or related data) to:
        * Use the precise new schema column names (e.g., `negotiator_id` instead of `created_by`, `property_address`, `welcome_email_body`)[cite: 1].
        * Ensure method parameters and logic align with the updated storage interface and the requirements for creating transactions, including adding parties to `email_subscriptions` with magic links, as outlined in Phase 1 of the implementation plan[cite: 1].

4.  **Iterative Testing:**
    * After completing each of the above steps (SQL syntax, storage layer alignment, controller updates), please attempt to create a new transaction. Log any errors encountered in detail.

The goal is to systematically resolve these foundational data layer issues first. Once transaction creation is working reliably from the backend perspective, we can then re-verify the end-to-end authentication flow if any problems persist.

Please proceed with step 1 and let me know how it goes or if you encounter any specific issues.
