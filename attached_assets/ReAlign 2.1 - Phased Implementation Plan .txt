ReAlign 2.1 - Phased Implementation Plan
Document Version: 1.3 (Updated with UBA Guide Insights) Date: May 27, 2025 Based On: ReAlign Product Requirements Document (PRD) 2.1.2 (Updated with UBA Guide Insights)
Changes in v1.3: Incorporated detailed procedural rules and data entry conventions from the "how to fill out borrower assistance form.docx" (UBA Guide) into relevant tasks, especially for the BFS/UBA Form Maker in Phase 1 and AI assistance features. This ensures the AI and application logic reflect expert best practices for UBA form completion. Changes in v1.2: Incorporated insights from "How to Build a Truly Useful AI Product" principles - removed over-engineered AI fallbacks, emphasized premium model usage while small, added Context Recipe framework, and simplified AI implementation strategies that will become obsolete with model improvements. Changes in v1.1: Incorporated reviewer feedback regarding Unified Case View clarity, AI feedback loop mechanisms, UI consistency for AI features, NLU service strategy, live help escalation scalability, and data migration planning.
1. Introduction This document outlines a phased implementation plan for developing ReAlign version 2.1, as detailed in the "ReAlign Product Requirements Document (PRD) 2.1.2 (Updated with UBA Guide Insights)". The primary goal of this plan is to manage complexity, de-risk development, and ensure that value is delivered iteratively, especially for the new AI-native scaffolding components. Each phase will define an MVP scope for these complex systems, allowing for focused development and early feedback. This plan is designed to be granular enough to guide an AI builder (like Replit AI) by breaking down larger requirements into more specific, actionable tasks.
Core Principles for Phased Implementation:
* Iterative Value: Each phase should deliver demonstrable value or critical learning.
* MVP First for Complexity: New complex systems (User Context, Logging, Normalization, Predictive Alerts) will start with an MVP and be expanded in later phases. This includes implementing foundational UBA form logic first, then enhancing with more nuanced AI assistance.
* Dependency Management: Phases will be structured to build upon each other logically.
* Premium AI Experience While Small: Leverage expensive, cutting-edge AI models to create Ferrari-level user experiences without worrying about per-user costs in early phases. This includes AI deeply understanding and applying UBA form rules.
* Context-Driven AI: Every AI feature will have a defined "Context Recipe" specifying exactly what data feeds into model prompts, including specific rules from the UBA Guide for relevant forms.
* Avoid Temporary Workarounds: Don't build complex systems to compensate for current AI model limitations that will be resolved by future releases.
* Flexibility: While detailed, the plan should allow for adjustments based on development progress and feedback.
2. Overall Phasing Strategy The implementation of ReAlign 2.1 will be divided into the following major phases:
* Phase 0: Foundation & Core AI Scaffolding (MVP)
* Phase 1: Maker Module - Core Tools with Premium AI Integration
* Phase 2: Advisor Module - AI Chatbot, Basic Guidance & AI Interaction Review Console (MVP)
* Phase 3: Tracker Module - Proactive Alerts & Enhanced, Unified Views
* Phase 4: Iteration, Expansion & Experimental Features
Phase 0: Foundation & Core AI Scaffolding (MVP) Objective: Establish the absolute minimum viable backend services and data structures for User Context Profile, Structured Workflow Logging, and Data Normalization. This phase focuses on the foundational plumbing required to support the first set of AI-enhanced user-facing features in subsequent phases.
Key Tasks & Deliverables:
* 0.1. User Authentication & Basic Profile (PRD 2.1: Section 3.1)
   * Task: Implement/Verify secure user registration, login (email/password), and basic profile management for Homeowner, Negotiator, and Agent roles.
   * Task: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) stubs -- define roles and basic permission checks.
* 0.2. User Context Profile - MVP (PRD 2.1: Section 3.1.1)
   * Task: Design and implement the database schema for the User Context Profile.
   * MVP Scope: Include essential fields to support initial pre-fill in Phase 1 (e.g., User ID, Full Name, Email, Phone, Property Address (if homeowner), Loan Number (if homeowner), primary hardship type (if known from onboarding) ). These fields are often sourced from "Zoho" or "financial intake" as per UBA Guide.
   * Reference data points from "enhanced dat model.docx" and UBA Form (Page 1).
   * Task: Create backend APIs (CRUD operations) for managing this MVP User Context Profile.
   * Task: Implement a basic onboarding step (e.g., during registration or first login) to capture these initial MVP context fields.
   * Task: Define Context Recipe Framework - Create standardized structure for specifying what contextual data feeds into each AI feature's prompts. This framework will later incorporate specific UBA Guide rules.
* 0.3. Structured Workflow Logging Engine - MVP (PRD 2.1: Section 3.4)
   * Task: Design and implement the database schema for logging.
   * MVP Scope: Focus on a single, simple table for initial event logging.
   * Key MVP Event Types to Log: User Registration, User Login, Case Creation, BFS/UBA Form Started, BFS/UBA Form Completed, AI Help Invoked (Maker), Live Help Requested (Maker), AI Context Used (track what context was provided to each AI interaction), AI Suggestion Accepted/Modified/Rejected.
   * Key MVP Data Points per Log: Timestamp, User ID, Case ID (if applicable), Event Type, basic event payload (e.g., {'case_id': '123', 'form_field': 'income_amount'}), Context Recipe ID (if AI interaction), AI Model Used, User Satisfaction Rating (if provided).
   * Task: Create a backend service/API endpoint (e.g., /log-event) for recording these MVP events.
   * Storage: Use the primary application database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for this MVP. Do not introduce a separate logging database in this phase.
   * Task: Integrate logging calls for the defined MVP event types at the relevant points in the application backend.
* 0.4. Data Normalization Layer - Conceptual & BFS/UBA Data Structure (PRD 2.1: Section 3.5)
   * Task: Design and implement the database schema for storing normalized BFS/UBA data. This schema must accommodate all fields from the UBA Form and related financial details (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) as outlined in the "enhanced dat model.docx" and be flexible enough to store data according to UBA Guide conventions (e.g., dual reporting of gross/net income, detailed expense structures).
   * This will be the core of the "Loss Mitigation Application" and "Financial Entry" tables from the "enhanced dat model.docx".
   * MVP Scope: Focus on accurately representing all fields from the UBA Form (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Form 710, as per UBA.pdf) and related financial details (income, expenses, assets, liabilities).
   * Ensure schema supports linking to Transaction and Party (Borrower, Co-Borrower).
   * Task: Create backend APIs (CRUD operations) for managing this normalized BFS/UBA data.
   * Note: Actual pre-filling from this layer into other forms will occur in Phase 1. This phase is about creating the storage and basic access for this normalized data.
* 0.5. Core Platform Setup
   * Task: Ensure the basic application shell (frontend and backend) is running, including navigation stubs for Tracker, Maker, and Advisor modules.
   * Task: Set up secure environment variable management (API keys, database credentials).
   * Task: Configure premium AI service access (OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, Claude Sonnet, etc.) - budget for higher per-interaction costs in favor of superior user experience.
   * Task: Confirm basic database connectivity and ORM setup (e.g., Drizzle ORM as per "ReAlign_Tracker MVP - Phased Implementation Plan.docx”).
* 0.6 Agent Experience (AX) Foundation
   * llms.txt creation with loss mitigation domain context.
   * OpenAPI specifications for all endpoints.
   * Agent-scoped authentication tokens and permissions.
   * Semantic metadata layer in Context Recipe framework.
   * Agent action audit trails in logging system.
* 0.7 AI Visibility Architecture
   * JSON-LD schema markup for all modules.
