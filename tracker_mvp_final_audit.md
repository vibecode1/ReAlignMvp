## REMAINING ITEMS TO IMPLEMENT ðŸ”§

### 1. Document Status Table Enhancements (Critical)
**Location**: `client/src/components/transactions/DocRequestList.tsx`
**Status**: Component exists but needs verification of full CRUD operations
- [ ] Verify "Add new document request" functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Verify "Edit existing request status" (Complete/Overdue/Pending) 
- [ ] Verify "Delete document request" functionality
- [ ] Verify revision notes capability
- [ ] Verify "Days Since Requested" calculation displays correctly

### 2. Backend API Endpoint Verification (Critical)
**Location**: Server controllers and routes
- [ ] Verify DELETE /api/v1/doc-requests/:requestId endpoint exists
- [ ] Verify PATCH /api/v1/uploads/:uploadId/visibility endpoint works
- [ ] Verify GET /api/v1/transactions includes proper lastActivityAt calculation

### 3. Welcome Email Trigger Integration (High Priority)
**Location**: `server/controllers/transactionController.ts`
- [ ] Integrate welcome email sending when creating transactions with parties
- [ ] Ensure welcome_email_body from transaction creation triggers sendTrackerMagicLink

### 4. Email Configuration Setup (High Priority)
- [ ] SendGrid API key needs to be configured in Replit Secrets
- [ ] Sender email verification in SendGrid
- [ ] Test email delivery functionality

### 5. Storage Interface Completion (Medium Priority)
**Location**: `server/storage.ts`
- [ ] Verify getEmailSubscriptionsByTransactionId works for empty string (all subscriptions)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript issues in notificationService.ts

## CRITICAL PATH TO COMPLETION

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Test document request CRUD operations end-to-end
2. Verify file visibility toggle functionality  
3. Set up SendGrid configuration for email testing
4. Test welcome email trigger on transaction creation
5. Verify weekly digest cron job functionality

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 2-3 hours

The Tracker MVP is 90% complete with core functionality working. The remaining items are primarily verification, testing, and email service configuration.
